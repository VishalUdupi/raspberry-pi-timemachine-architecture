## Docker Compose Design

Each service in the compose file has a single responsibility.

- The Time Machine container writes only to the hot storage tier
- The archive container exposes only completed backups
- The monitoring container has no storage responsibilities

This separation ensures that performance issues in one service do not cascade
into others.
